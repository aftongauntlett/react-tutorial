# React Tutorial Project

This project is designed to help you learn React, Node.js, Express, and other modern web development concepts through hands-on implementation.

## Project Structure

- /src - React frontend code
- /server - Express backend server
- /tailwind.config.js - Tailwind CSS configuration

## Getting Started

### Install frontend dependencies

```javascript
npm install
```

### Install server dependencies

```javascript
cd server
npm install
```

(See /server/README.md for backend environment setup and database configuration)

### Start the Express backend

```javascript
cd server
npm run dev
```

### In a separate terminal, start the React frontend

```javascript
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to see the app running.

## Technologies Used

- React (with hooks and functional components)
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (v3.4.3)
- Express (Node.js backend)
- Postman (for API testing)
- DBeaver (visual database client for managing MySQL)
- ESLint & Prettier (code quality)
- ChatGPT (GPT-4o & GPT-4-turbo) — used for code reviews, teaching explanations, and architecture planning
- Windsurf — experimental AI coding environment used for code generation and scaffolding

## Learning Goals

- Practice React fundamentals: state, props, hooks, components
- Strengthen understanding of Node.js and Express API building
- Build full-stack apps with React + Express
- Write clean, maintainable code using TypeScript
- Improve frontend styling with Tailwind CSS
- Reinforce Git/GitHub usage for version control

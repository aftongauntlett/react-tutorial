# Git & Terminal Guide for the Stanley Parable Tutorial

## You're absolutely right about Git and terminals!

### Git is Shell-Agnostic ✅

Git commands are the same regardless of programming language:

- `git status` works in JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Haskell projects
- `git add .` is universal across all languages
- `git commit -m "message"` doesn't change based on your code language
- `git push`, `git pull`, `git merge` are consistent everywhere

### Shell Choice Matters for Developer Experience

**What developers actually choose between:**

1. **Bash** (`$`) - Linux/older macOS default

   - Most common in tutorials and documentation
   - Universal compatibility

2. **Zsh** (`❯`) - Modern macOS default (since Big Sur)

   - Better auto-completion and themes
   - Popular with developers who customize their setup

3. **PowerShell** (`PS>`) - Windows developers

   - Microsoft's modern shell
   - Different syntax but same git commands

4. **Fish** (`>`) - Developer-friendly shell

   - Great suggestions and auto-completion
   - Growing popularity

5. **Command Prompt** (`C:\>`) - Basic Windows shell
   - Still used in corporate environments

### Why This Feature is Great for Your Tutorial:

**Accessibility**: Developers feel comfortable in their preferred shell
**Realism**: Shows you understand actual dev workflows  
**Inclusivity**: Windows developers don't feel left out
**Polish**: Demonstrates attention to real-world developer experience

### Commands Stay the Same:

```bash
# These work in ANY shell:
git status
git add .
git commit -m "fix: update button color"
git push origin main
git pull
git merge feature-branch
```

### Only the Prompt Changes:

- Bash: `$ git status`
- Zsh: `❯ git status`
- PowerShell: `PS> git status`
- Fish: `> git status`

Your instinct is perfect - this feature adds authenticity without complexity!
